** Keylogger Definition: A keylogger is a tool designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a keyboard. While it can be used for legitimate purposes, it's crucial to note that unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

** Dependencies: The primary dependency for this keylogger is the pynput library, which allows monitoring and controlling input devices.

## Steps to Implement the Keylogger:

** Install the pynput Library:  pip install pynput

** Import Necessary Module:  from pynput import keyboard

** Define Callback Functions:
=> on_press(key): Handles events when a key is pressed.
=> on_release(key): Handles events when a key is released and stops the listener upon pressing the 'Esc' key.

** Set Up the Listener:

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
